    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <h3>A Short Essay About How I Got Here
      and Also, <em>Content</em>!</h2>
    </h3>

    <p>I have been interested in coding for some time now, but I never
      thought of myself as being very "technically-minded". I realized after 
      some time that that mentality was actually a trap, and when I saw a friend
      of mine getting into it, I figured I would give it a go. I've
      been messing around in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for about 3 months now, 
      and I couldn't be happier to finally be here. 
    </p>

    <p>I don't know specifically which route I am going to take, 
      but I am open to it all until I start to get a handle on things. Right now
      JavaScript is really fun to me, but I am also really curious about both
      Ruby and C#, as well as Python. I'm glad we have the option here. I am leaning more towards
      C# only because there are a lot of jobs in the area that require C# knowledge,
      but I know that I'll be giving Ruby a go in my own time, and possibly even
      find a job with it. I'd like to live out West at some point, and I know it's 
      big out there. Some day I'd like to work remotely, too, but one step at a time!
